# Stock Price Prediction System

## Introduction
Welcome to our Stock Price Prediction System! This system leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast stock prices, providing valuable insights for traders and investors. Whether you're interested in real-time predictions or analyzing predefined historical data, our system offers a versatile solution.

## Features

### 1. LSTM Model
Our prediction system is powered by LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction tasks. LSTM's ability to capture long-term dependencies in data makes it ideal for forecasting stock prices.

### 2. Real-Time Prediction
For real-time predictions, the system continuously fetches the latest stock price data and utilizes the LSTM model to predict future prices. This allows users to make informed decisions based on the most recent market trends.

### 3. Predefined Data Analysis
In addition to real-time predictions, our system supports the analysis of predefined historical data. Users can input historical stock prices to generate predictions and gain insights into potential future trends.

### 4. Model Training and Tuning
The system provides functionality for model training and tuning. Users can train the LSTM model on historical data, optimizing its parameters to enhance prediction accuracy. This ensures adaptability to different market conditions.
